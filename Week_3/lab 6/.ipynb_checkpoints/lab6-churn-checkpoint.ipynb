Clearly, when FN are more expensive than FP, you want to lower this threshold: you are ok with falsely classifying -ive examples as +ive.

As another example, consider the cancer story from the previous chapter. The decision may be: ought we biopsy, or ought we not biopsy. By minimizing the estimation risk, we obtain a probability that the patient has cancer. We must mix these probabilities with \"business knowledge\" or \"domain knowledge\" to make a decision.\n",

The first one, the one equivalent to the log loss is the one where we say that at each point the prediction for y is a gaussian....the samples of this gaussian come from the bootstrap we make on the original data set...each replication leads to a new line and a distribution for the prediction at a point x. But usually in a regression we just quote the mean of this distribution at each point, the regression line E[y|x]. Why the mean? The mean comes from choosing a least squares decision loss...if we chose a L1 loss, we'd be looking at a median.)\n",

So far we have used a method to calculate a rough threshold from the cost/utility matrix, and seen the ROC curve which implements one classifier per threshold to pick an appropriate model.

We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. In addition to what we do for the ROC curve, we now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",
